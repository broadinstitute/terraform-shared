Here is a list of items that should be added to this module in order to improve its utility.
 * Allow passing in of configuration settings specific to be used as arguments to the downstream modules.
 * Allow not creating some of the elments.
 * Once labeling of external IP addresses is no [longer in beta](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources), we should have that resource be labeled as well

For expanding ability to pass in configuration settings to downstream modules, I envision this being a map for each "element".  The map would have key/values specific to the configuration values that the downstream module supports.
